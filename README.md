# C Schedule Project

## Description
This project was made to learn the basics of programming in C, this is a first release and may exist a lot of bugs but I am happy with the work.
The project is actually functional and you can use it for personal purposes.

## Next implementations
Mi idea is to improve the errors control in relation to the max storage size and something like that.
> [EXAMPLE]
> If you want to save a very large description and you write over the max size of the variable, the program allows you to do it.

### To Add confirm buttons to avoid _missclicks_
If you click the delete button, there are no more oportunities, that information is over.

### Add notifications
> [EXAMPLE]
> If today is the birthday of your mum, the program notificates you when you open the pc

# How to use it ?
> ⚠️
> The most important thing is to not delete the schedules folder and don't change the name of anything. 


Go to the `sources` folder and open the `GUI_main.exe` from your file browser or terminal.
If you execute the program from a file browser you will notice that a terminal is opened, that's pending for me.

### Explanation of the code and the process of making it
This can be found on the branch `GUI_analized_dev/notes`, if you open this notes with https://obsidian.md/.
