### DEPENDENCIES ###
-> Compilation arguments for GUI functions:
    -lgdi32

### Flow of the GUI: ###
There are various different screens, on each screen, different labels and buttons, so each screen has its labels
and its buttons

Se we need to describe each screen ->
Screen_t 
{
    labels&buttons: list
} 

So the menu is described with its ID and it's respective screen for each ID,
corresponding the ID of the menu with a the index of the array that contains the screens

### Definitions of the ID of the buttons ###
[0] -> DELETE_SCHEDULE
[1] -> NEW_SCHEDULE
[2 - 99] -> SELECT SCHEDULE
[>= 100] -> DAY BUTTON


1.
There are no days shown until the user selects an schedule

2.
The user will see a calendar, this calendar shows 1 month at a time, so the starting month shown will be
the actual one (got with the local time of the pc), then the user is able to change the DD/MM/YYYY
When the days of the month are displayed, by default they will be GRAY, but the days that contains at least 1 event,
will be BLUE

3.
Then when the user clicks a day we list the events of that day at the right side of the screen
, showing the hour:minute:second and the description of the event
